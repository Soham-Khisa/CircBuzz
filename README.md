In this application we intend to make an
application that shows all the history
and the latest updates of cricket matches.
The project will eventually have two modules, one
is <em>HelloFX</em> which can be found in the directories above,
the other is the client side module of the project which
is not present currently (we hope to work on that ASAP).
The whole purpose of the project is to show Database
connectivity with java or JDBC in a single word. Therefore,
we have no intention to include sockets in this application
for networking that means this application will be completely
offline. For this project we are using oracle database and
its ojdbc6.jar library with c3p0 connection
pooling libraries.
